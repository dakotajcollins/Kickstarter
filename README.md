# Week-1
## Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

## Work

The StarterBookFinal.xlsx has some statistical analysis done through excel. You can read my findings in the word document.

Sheet 1 contains conditional formating to show a visual difference in the state and the percent funded columns. 
Sheet 2 contains a pivot table with a breakdown of the state of the kickstarter based on category.
Sheet 3 contains something similar to sheet 2, but based on the subcategories.
Sheet 4 contains success rates of kickstarters, but based on the time of year they were launched.
Sheet 5 contains the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled kickstarters based on the goal amount.
Sheet 6 contains an overview of the statistical breakdown of the kickstarters.
